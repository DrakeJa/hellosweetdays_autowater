# Hello Sweet Days auto waterer and partier
Hello! Welcome to the Hello Sweet Days auto watering and partying script written in Python. 
This script was written since I have very little time or patience to sit there and click 3 buttons over and over 
again to make money in a game that will fizzle out in give or take 2 years.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- If you play on an iOS device: Hello Sweet Days account that is linked to Facebook
- An Android emulator:
  - [MEmu Play (Windows)](https://www.memuplay.com/download.html)
  - [Bluestacks (Windows, macOS)](https://www.bluestacks.com/download.html)
  - [NoxPlayer (Windows, macOS)](https://www.bignox.com/)
  - [Android-x86 (Linux)](https://www.android-x86.org/)

Once you have the emulator downloaded and installed, you have two options to install Hello Sweet Days:

1. Method 1:  
   - Login to Google on the Android emulator and download it from the Google Play Store
2. Method 2
   - [Download the .xapk file from APKPure](https://apkpure.com/hello-sweet-days/jp.cocone.sweetdays) 
   - Install the .xapk file according to your emulator (you can find this out through a quick Google search probably)

Now that you have Hello Sweet Days installed, launch the app and login with Facebook.

### Setting up the script

It is highly recommended that you download and install [PyCharm Community Edition](https://www.jetbrains.com/pycharm/download/)
if you want to run everything from a GUI. Otherwise, you will have to start and stop the script
from the command line.

You should also download and install [git](https://git-scm.com/downloads).

Once both are installed, you can clone this repository!

To clone this repository:

- Click the big green button that says "<> Code" at the top of this page
- Copy the URL under HTTPS
- Open Terminal if you are on macOS/Linux or Command Prompt if you are on Windows
- In Terminal, type: ```cd ~/Documents``` or whatever folder you want to have the script in
- Then in Terminal, type: ```git clone REPLACE_THIS_WITH_THE_LINK_YOU_COPIED```
- Congratulations! You have the script.

Now you will want to open the script folder in PyCharm Community Edition:
- Open PyCharm
- Click 'Open'
- Choose the 'hellosweetdays_autowater' folder
